# FitNet-App

# Introduction
FitNet is a fitness app created to help users during their fitness journey. The app can help the users set and strive for their fitness goals, whether it's weight loss, strength or endurance. The user can take down any exercise of their choice and have the option to take down the corresponding weight and reps. This is important for gym goers as noticing increases in the number of reps directly improves muscular endurance while increasing the weight correlates to hypertrophy(increase and growth of muscle) and strength. This data is then saved for the user to continue to look back on and improve.
